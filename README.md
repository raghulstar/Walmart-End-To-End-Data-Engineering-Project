## 📖 Introduction
The **Walmart Store Sales Prediction** project leverages Azure Data Factory, CI/CD pipelines, and machine learning models to predict weekly sales for Walmart stores. This project is a blend of robust data engineering and advanced machine learning techniques to create a production-ready solution.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Built scalable pipelines for ingesting raw datasets.
- **Data Processing**: Transformed data into bronze, silver, and gold layers.
- **Model Training**: Trained Random Forest and Linear Regression models to predict weekly sales.
- **Visualization**: Solution and pipeline architecture visualizations.
- **Deployment**: Integrated CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment.
